# javascript_api_calls

Really basic html with javascript embedded to handle API calls to Weather API and News API. The API call is done using axios.

CSS style sheet that goes with it is basic and just makes it so there is no white background. 

For the future, it would be best to use a front-end tool such as React or Vue in order to really give the page character.
